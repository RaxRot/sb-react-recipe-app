## üìñ Project Overview
RecipeHub is a **full stack recipe sharing application** built with a strong backend in **Java Spring Boot** and a modern frontend using **React + Tailwind CSS**.  
It allows users to **register, log in, create recipes with images**, browse and filter recipes by difficulty, and comment on recipes.  
Administrators have access to a dedicated panel to manage users.

This project demonstrates both **backend engineering skills** (security, REST API design, AWS S3 integration, validation) and **frontend development** (responsive UI, routing, form handling, toasts).

- **Spring Boot 3**, **Spring Security (JWT)**, **JPA/Hibernate**, **MySQL**

- **REST API** with CRUD for recipes and comments
- **Image upload to AWS S3**
- Backend validation with meaningful error responses
